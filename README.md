# Hotel-Management-Project
 Hotel management project involves creating a MySQL database named Hotel_management connected to Python using MySQL connectors. The database includes four tables: rooms and bills for managing customer bookings and calculating room bills, and resitems and resbill for storing restaurant service data. The program begins by displaying the hotel name "G.P.A" and offers five choices: booking rooms and suites, accessing restaurant services with a menu, checking booking details by customer name or room number, canceling bookings, and exiting the program. Various features are employed, such as functions, local and global variables, if-elif-else statements, MySQL cursor and commit functions, loops, and SQL queries for modifying table data within the database.
